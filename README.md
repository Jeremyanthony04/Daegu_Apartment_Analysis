# DAEGU APARTMENT ANALYSIS




Daegu City or known as the Metropolitan City of Daegu is a city surrounded by mountains in South Korea with a population of more than 2.5 million people. 

As the 3rd largest metropolitan city in South Korea after Seoul and Busan, like other metropolitan cities, apartments are one of the answers to the residential needs of modern society due to limited residential land and dense business activities in urban areas. 

In addition, in 2020, the apartment price index in Daegu City was 88.2, or grew 1.9% compared to the previous year, so this shows the potential growth in apartment sales and interest in buying apartments in Daegu City.

Majority of residents, especially in big cities in South Korea, prefer to sell or buy apartments through real estate agents, so this has encouraged many real estate agents to offer their services to help sell or buy apartments.
